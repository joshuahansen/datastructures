hyphen (-) is not listed as a delimter therefor the list of words in the not found list 
contains words starting with the hyphen

some of the datastructures reorder the fuzzy word matches so running diff on the 
output files gives differences because of the order of the words but the words are the same.

In the make file each text file (big.txt, kaddath,txt and kjv.txt) has its own command and output file
for easy of testing and comparing the results of the different data structures
